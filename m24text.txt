Memorable and inspiring
Your visit to Tanzania is incomplete if you haven't experienced this awesome safari from the sky. This allows you to explore untouched and more inaccessible parts of the Serengeti as you casually drift over the surface of the earth as the dawn breaks. You are safe in the basket of a hot air balloon, sometimes drifting only feet above the wildlife. Join us for a memorable balloon safari in the Serengeti followed by a champagne bush breakfast. Bases in Seronera, Kirawira, Ndutu and Kogatende allow us to follow the great migration all year round.
